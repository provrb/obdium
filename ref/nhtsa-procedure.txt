K L 4 C J A S B
* * * * * | * B

Look through pattern. Example pattern: *****|*B
For each pattern that was found with key *****|*B
	Search Wmi_VinSchema
		Find row that matches WmiId and model year is between 'YearFrom' - 'YearTo'

Key: 
	First 5 characters '*'
	Sixth character '|'
	Seventh character '*'
	Eight character - eigth character in vin

Hello,
I'm emailing about your vPIC MSSQL Server database.
I'm in the process of reverse engineering it to make it work with my Rust app alongside SQLite instead of MSSQL. I've been trying to figure out this feature for quite a while and don't seem to understand it.
In the 'Pattern' table, there is a column labelled 'Keys'. In order to find out the VinSchemaId, you look for any matches that happen with a key (e,g CJASB|JB660929) and then you can find further detailed information about the vehicle with that ID. However, what I don’t fully understand is how the transformation from CJASB|JB660929 results in a match with a pattern like *J[A-H1-3]*B. Specifically, what logic or method is used to go from a key like CJASB|JB660929 to matching a pattern like *J[A-H1-3]*B?
Here is the output that your code is retrieving for CJASB|JB660929- which is completely correct: 

The VIN is KL4CJASB6JB660929.
Sorry for any inconvenience.Thank you,
Ethan Oliveira
